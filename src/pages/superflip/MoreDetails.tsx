          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Late Shows:</b> Only if you call in advance. Groups will still
            start at 7:30 and will plunge a ball after 1 minute of wait for your
            turn. If you call and no-show you will get a zero in the group for
            that week. If you show up late with no call, you will not be added
            to a group.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are assigned a division restriction (if necessary) based on TD
            discretion when you sign up to play.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you join after week 1, you will be assigned to the middle of the
            standings for the tiered groupings for that week.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will play four games each week consisting of 2 games in 2
            separate rounds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>
              The first round will be <b>random pairings:</b>
            </i>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Game selection and opponents will be random selection, play in
                the order given
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>
              The second round will be <b>tiered pairings:</b>
            </i>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Opponent selection is based on the cumulative league standings
                based on average score from weeks played not counting the
                current week (E.g., groupings will be 1/2/3/4, 5/6/7/8, etc.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Game & order choice & selection is as follows: 2,1,3,4 for game
                1; 1,2,3,4 for game 2
              </li>
              <li>Week 1 seeding for tiered selection is based on IFPA rank</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            All rounds score the same: 7/5/3/1 scoring for 1st/2nd/3rd/4th
            (7/4/1 scoring for three player groups)
          </li>
          <li>
            Your lowest 2 weeks scores are dropped and your top 4 weeks scores
            accumulate to your final qualifying score for finals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ties will be broken by your drop week (or lowest 2 weeks) scores
            (highest score, then second highest score). If a tie still exists, a
            1 game playoff will take place to determine seeding.

        <h5>FINALS</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Check-in starts at <b>6:00pm</b>; first round starts at{" "}
            <b>6:30pm</b> sharp!
          </li>
          <li>
            Finals participants are based on their division restrictions (this
            is denoted when you join league) - if you do not qualify for your
            division restriction (or higher) you will be placed in the X
            division.
          </li>
          <li>
            Groupings are based on multiples of 16 (this assumes at least 32
            players; this will be modified to reduce the field for A division by
            50% if less than 32).
          </li>
          <li>
            Anyone qualifying outside of the multiple of 16 will be placed in
            the X division
            <ul>
              <li>
                E.g., with 38 players, top 16 players make A division, the next
                16 players make B division, the last 6 make X division. With 52
                players, top 16 A, next 16 B, next 16 C, last 4 X (and so
                forth).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            All players participate in finals, prizes for top 4 in all divisions
            (prize breakdown TBD)
          </li>
          <li>
            Finals format: PAPA style matchplay (3 games each round, 4/2/1/0
            scoring)
          </li>
          <li>Max one group can wait for game in finals</li>
          <li>Extra balls should be plunged</li>

          <li>
            Gameplay on any game is permitted between rounds, but not during a
            match.
          </li>

        <h5>RULINGS</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We follow the PAPA/IFPA standards regarding all rulings. These can
            be viewed at{" "}
            <a
              href="https://www.ifpapinball.com/rules/"

          </li>
          <li>
            Out of turn play disqualifies the player for that game. Score for
            the person affected will a) be reduced back to the original score if
            it can be proven, or b) be retained as it stands. In either case,
            the player will receive a compensation ball at the end of the game
            with this score added to the original score.
          </li>
          <li>
            Extra balls must be plunged and not played. Played EBs are
            considered “out of turn” and the players score will be disqualified.
          </li>
          <li>
            Must trap ball(s) & call a TD for any stuck ball situation (single
            or multiball play), or for any issues during gameplay.
          </li>
          <li>
            Player conduct is determined by the TDs. A DQ of the player on that
            game will take place for most infractions (interference, slam tilts
            (machine abuse), bangback/deathsaves, cheating, dissapearing during
            a match, etc.) but a yellow card can also be issued for conduct
            deemed detrimental to the league (including repeated offenses
            requiring a DQ). A red card will be issued for the second infraction
            disqualying the player for the season. TDs will review at the end of
            the season for future seasons should the player want to rejoin the
            league.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scoring is the responsibility of the groups. Once scores are
            submitted they are considered final.
